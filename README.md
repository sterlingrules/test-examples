JS Test Examples

A few tests I've done recently. These are for different projects, grouped into one spec sheet. Some tests have been marked pending, that is because they require just too many dependencies to run succesfully, however they did test sucessfully when they were a part of their original application and environments.

Requires:
* Needs to be ran from a server, or opening Chrome with the flag `--allow-file-access-from-files`. This is to allow fixtures to be ran.
